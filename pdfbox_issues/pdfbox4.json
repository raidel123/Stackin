One difference i observed between the \nextraction of text by acrobat professional and PDFBox is \nthat while exracting the text from the pdf file, the \nPDFBox extracts even the text from the image object if \nthere is some text present, but the acrobat doesn't do \nthat it eliminates the text which is present in the \nimages. So that makes the difference. When we start \nextract the text from the images if there is some text \nwhich is in a non-ascii format then that text is \nrepresented as a box because it is extracted as it from \nthe image. The acrobat avoids this type of extraction and \ndoes not give any box. \n\nThis is only my view if i am wrong thn please excuse me.\nI am waiting for your reply on this.\n\nThanking you\n\nRegards,\nGovardhana\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by govardhana.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1452645\n\nHi Ben,\n\nEven i am facing the same problem.

It adds\ngetter-Functions to the PDXFA, that return\norg.w3c.Element-Objects for the XFA. \n\nI will have to try modifing them by hand, and will\nprovide write support in the next patch.\n\nSome questions left open:\n\n- Is it okey to handle errors like i did with\nRuntimeExceptions?\n\n- Maybe i missed the point in my modification of\nCOSDictionaryMap.convertBasicTypesToMap(). I like it\nmore like it is the wys i did, but maybe it breks\nsomething on your side so please check.\n\n- I added getStreamAsString-Functions to COSStream,\nsince most interesting Streams are ASCII anyway.\n\n\n[attachment on SourceForge]\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=78314&atid=552835&aid=1420152&file_id=165613\npatch.txt (text/plain), 6546 bytes\npatch to add limited, basic access to xml-forms.\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by benlitchfield.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=601708\n\nThanks for taking the time to submit a patch, but we should \ntalk a little about how we want this designed.\n\nToday forms are written in two ways, the old way using \nCOSDictionary and the new way using XML forms.  It would be \nnice if there was a single API that people could use that \nwould update fields in both spots.  Need to think about how \nwe can do that.  Such that both old and new get written \nproperly and people who use PDFBox don't have to write it \nin both spots.\n\nAlso, despite popular belief I have never met anyone that \nactually wants to work in XML object model, most people \nwould rather use a standard java object model.  \n\nFor example, I would be willing to bet that most people \nwould rather see\n\npublic XFAConfig getConfigXML()\n\nrather than\n\npublic Element getConfigXML()\n\nReturing an XML element means that the user is required to \ngo look at the XFA documentation to know what is in there \nand handle any details themselves.  If a XFAConfig(or \nwhatever name) was returned that could do it for them.  \nMaybe the XFAConfig simply holds as a data member an \nElement object and is really just a wrapper, just like most \npdmodel objects are just wrappers to COSDictionaries.\n\nBen","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"289401","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Accessing XML-Forms (patch provided)","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-127/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1dwqn:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391160","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391160","key":"PDFBOX-126","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/6","id":"6","description":"The problem isn't valid and it can't be fixed.","name":"Invalid"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Fri Oct 10 22:17:09 UTC 2014","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_274378629627_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84959","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2014-10-10T22:17:09.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-126/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":false},"created":"2006-01-30T06:00:00.000+0000","priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2014-10-10T22:17:09.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

On the otherhand, acrobar reader as well as pdfbox\nclearly seem not to decrypt the palette string.\nI am not an expert at cryptography, but I imagine, that this\ncould have the following reason:\nSince palettes are often known (windows standard palette,\nweb-palette etc.) encrypting them, might give an attacker a\nreasonable guess at what the cleartext of the encrypted\nstring should look like. Hence, if he was able to use a\nclear-text attack against the palette string he could use\nthe extracted key for all other streams in the file.\nSince the a palette does not include very sensitive\ninformation by itself, it might be a more secure choice to\nnot encrypt it at all, in order to protect from such\nclear-text attacks.\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by benlitchfield.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=601708\n\nstrings should be encrypted, but there are some exceptions.  \nthanks for looking further into this for me.  I will check with \nthe PDF reference to see if it says anything.  the exceptions \nare usually security related so I would be surprised if it was \nnot suppose to encrypted, there it might be something related.\n\nBen\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by loppermann.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1359988\n\nok, if all strings are not encrypted, Docuemnt information\nwill get messed up, i.e. it will be encrypted during\ndecryption :)\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by loppermann.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1359988\n\nmy observation of the palatte staying intact seems to be\nwrong. after some more testing and debugging, I see, that\nthe palette seems to get encrypted, which I think it should\nnot be. Due to the symmetric nature of RC4, encrypting,\ndecrypting and encrypting again will yield the right\npalette. So even PDFBox does not try to decypt the palette\nstring it has encrypted when opening and decrypting the PDF.\nWhen I disable the encryption of Strings in the PDFWriter,\neverything seems to work fine. I haven't found this in the\nspec yet, with which I'm not so familiar. I will keep\nlooking though.\n\nSo if in fact strings should not be encrypted (and the fact\nthat they are not decrypted seems to imply this), the fix is\nsimply to take out the encryption of strings in PDFWriter.\n\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by loppermann.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1359988\n\nattached test case\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by loppermann.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1359988\n\nattached result.pdf file with messed up colors","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"205551","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Indexed color images have wrong colors after encryption","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-99/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0zk1z:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391132","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391132","key":"PDFBOX-98","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/2","id":"2","description":"A new feature of the product, which has yet to be developed.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21141&avatarType=issuetype","name":"New Feature","subtask":false,"avatarId":21141},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12313346","id":"12313346","description":"Apache PDFBox (incubating)","name":"0.8.0-incubator","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2009-09-23"}],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/1","id":"1","description":"A fix for this issue is checked into the tree and tested.","name":"Fixed"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Sat Jan 17 19:12:49 UTC 2009","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_104136229163_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"163049","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2009-01-17T19:12:49.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-98/watchers","watchCount":0,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-09-30T12:29:00.000+0000","priority":null,"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"12323349","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLink/12323349","type":{"id":"12310000","name":"Duplicate","inward":"is duplicated by","outward":"duplicates","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/12310000"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"12391142","key":"PDFBOX-108","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391142","fields":{"summary":"Support printing of Type0Font","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I create form with Adobe Form Designer (included in \nAcrobat Professional 7). \nThe form is complex and has lots of JavaScript to \nvalidate, change, and even dynamically fill data from \nremote Web Service! \n2. Then I add usage rights with Reader Extension \nServer, so that the form can be signed with digital \nsignature with the free version of Reader \n3. Then, place the PDF form file on a WEB server (ex. \nApache) and \"give\" it to the users :) \n \nSo far, so good! When a user fills in the form fields, he \nor she submits the whole PDF file back to a server \napplication for further processing. In my case this app is \na Java Servlet. \n \nWhat I need is to extract all the fields from the pdf file \nincluding the digital signature. \nI know that this has been discussed already, BUT the \nsimple code does not work. I suppose that the problem \nis with the output pdf file from Form Designer. \nThe \"not working part\" is this: \n \nPDDocument pdfDocument = PDDocument.load\n(pdfFile); \nPDAcroForm form = pdfDocument.getDocumentCatalog\n().getAcroForm(); \nList flist = form.getFields(); \n \nHere in \"flist\" I get a single element which is null. \n-----------------------------------------\nHi, again. I was on a travel so the \"pdf problem\" was off \nfor a while, but now it is up and bugging me again. \nHere is what I got: I have a form designed with Designer \n7, which has a button of type \"submit pdf\". This is \nbecause the form has a digital signature field and if I \nchoose \"submit xml\" the Sig filed is not submited. The \nsubmit action is to a Java servlet where I dump the byte \nstream to a file. \nWhat I would like to do is get the data from each field \nincluding the digital signature so I can validate it. The \nPrintFields example works as long as the form is NOT \nsigned. In my case I could get the form structure but all \nthe fields (filed.getValue() or field.toString()) are null, and \non the digital signature the is nothing in the COS \ndictionary about certificate or something. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, I found where is the problem. When I sign and \nsave the document in pdf-1.6 format in the raw pdf file I \nget 3 pdf forms. I guess history changes are also saved. \nThe first form is blank (fields/textboxes are blank/null), \nthe second is with values and the digital signature and \nthe third is the same as the second one but is saved \nbecause (I guess again) the Submit button was pressed \nand this is a change. \nAs I looked at the code of PDFBox more careful I \nsupose that the pdf box gets the first form only which in \nmy case is blank.","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"251062","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"error extracting fields from pdf with usage rights.","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-97/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i17cx3:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391130","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391130","key":"PDFBOX-96","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/8","id":"8","description":"The described issue is not actually a problem - it is as designed.","name":"Not A Problem"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Fri Oct 10 22:28:01 UTC 2014","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_285194341110_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84948","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2014-10-10T22:28:01.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-96/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-09-27T01:49:00.000+0000","priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2014-10-10T22:28:01.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Let's\nhave a look at the following stream in the attached\ndocument:\n\n174 0 obj\n<<\n/Length 94\n/LayerCreator /Neevia\n/LayerID <c5593367f4b69653b3dd4f771209026a>\n/LayerXML 177 0 R\n/Filter [ /FlateDecode ]\n/DecodeParms [ null ]\n>>\nstream\n     <the 94 bytes of the stream>\nendstream\nendobj\n\nAs described in the PDF Reference this document uses\nthe possibility to define an array of filters instead\nof just one filter(name). In the above case the array\ncontains only one element (filter). In this case it\nshould also define an array of dictionaries (one for\neach filter) which it does.\n\nNow the decode() method is passed a parametere options\nwhich imho should be the dictionary with the parameters\nfor this filter instance. Instead the options parameter\n actually is the stream itself (COSStream is derived\nfrom COSDictionary) which contains the filter\nparameters in DecodeParms. Now if you have a COSArray\nof COSDictionaries in the entry DecodeParms then you\nhave no way of knowing which set (index) of parameters\nyou should use. I think that the parameter options\nshould contain the dictionary with the parameters\nitself (not the stream). This affects a few places\ncalling the method. \n\nAlso another bug is on line 78 in the same method:\n\n            predictor = dict.getInt(\"Predictor\");\n            colors = dict.getInt(\"Colors\");\n -->       bitsPerPixel =\noptions.getInt(\"BitsPerComponent\");\n            columns = dict.getInt(\"Columns\");\n\nthe parameter BitsPerComponent is stored at the same\nlocation as columns. Therefore it should be from the\nvariable dict that the BitsPerComponent are retrieved.\nTo me it looks as if originally the parameter options\nused to be the decode parameters and it has been\nchanged later on (I don't know for which reason).\n\ncheers\nYves","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"206181","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ClassCastException in FlateFilter","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-95/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0znxz:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391128","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391128","key":"PDFBOX-94","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12313346","id":"12313346","description":"Apache PDFBox (incubating)","name":"0.8.0-incubator","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2009-09-23"}],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/1","id":"1","description":"A fix for this issue is checked into the tree and tested.","name":"Fixed"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Fri Jan 16 17:34:22 UTC 2009","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_105341842211_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"163048","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2009-01-16T17:34:22.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-94/watchers","watchCount":0,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-09-15T11:57:00.000+0000","priority":null,"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2009-10-21T09:52:01.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Shouldn't the && operator be a || ?\n\ncheers\nYves\n\n\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by thib_gc.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=736114\n\nI agree with reporter yves_bussard that the && in line 94 is\nhighly likely supposed to be ||. Clearly, the three-boolean\nstatement has no non-trivial meaning, even with parentheses.\n\nThe Fifth Edition (PDF 1.6) states the following about the\npossible value of (what is in that Java code) the variable\n\"predictor\":\n\n 1  No prediction (the default value)\n 2  TIFF Predictor 2\n 10 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG None on all rows)\n 11 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Sub on all rows)\n 12 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Up on all rows)\n 13 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Average on all rows)\n 14 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Paeth on all rows)\n 15 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG optimum)\n\n(Table 3.8, page 52) The value 10 isn't very significant;\nthough it flags the data as PNG, it declares that there is\nno prediction. The value 1 is the canonical declaration that\nthere is no prediction. Thus it seems quite normal that -1,\n1 and 10 (-1 being the default in the code) all go down the\nsame code path.\n\nAs it stands in 0.7.3, the \"else\" branch that start line 102\nnever gets executed, yet it seems to deal with images. So\nwhile I don't have a sample file on hand, it would seem that\nsome particular encodings of PNG images may trigger a\nproblem by going down a path with no prediction even though\nthey require a predictor function. (I don't know what the\n0.7.4 code looks like.)\n\n\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by yves_bussard.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=908162\n\nThis line actually is not the source of my problem.

Generally speaking, I highly \nappreciated your effort in developing such a wonderful open-\nsource package.\nI am interesting in developing a PDF to RTF converter.  Its \nmain features include keeping all text attributes such as \nstrikethru, underlined, fonts attributes, and spacing.  In the \npast, I successfully developed an application in C++ using \nXPDF package and added code to do what I want.\nNow I would like to implement these features using PDFBox \nto deploy the application in a J2EE environment.\n\nHere's the basic algorithm they use in XPDF.  First, they \nbuild a link list of string nodes. These string nodes contain x-\ny coordinates of text strings. Like your TextPosition \ninstance, however their string nodes also contain all \ninformation about their coordinates including LowerLeft X,Y \nand UpperRight X-Y.  They call yMin, yMax and xMin, xMax.\nThey store all these Strings nodes in major y-x axis.\n\nThen they coalesce and merge all string nodes with the \nsame Y-coordinate first, therefore I was able to extract and \nconvert into RTF and maintain the same content and format \nof PDF file.\nI am trying to figure out how to add extra information to your \nTextPosition class, so later on, I will be able to traverse thru \nmajor y-axis and build a list of these string nodes.\n\nIf you can provide me information needed to obtain all \ninformation about coordinates or position of a text string, I \nthink I will be able to implement these features. I will \ncontribute these codes to your project.\nI uploaded a header file from XPDF, a sample PDF file which I \ntried to convert and an RTF file.\nI am not trying to convert \"TABLE\" from PDF file.  I \nunderstand that concept does not exist in PDF.\n\n \nThanks,\n\n \nTan V. Nguyen\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by benlitchfield.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=601708\n\ntext in a pdf document is drawn at x/y locations.  Which \nmeans there is no relationship to text drawn in a column.  If \nyou can propose an algorithm to determine columns of text \nthen I will implement it.  As a side note, there is no such \nthing as a 'table' in a pdf document, only lines drawn between \ntwo points and text drawn at x/y locations.  The only way \na 'column' of could be determined is by analyzing lines on the \nPDF document, not an easy thing to do.\n\nBen Litchfield","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"289372","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Processing horizontally first then horizontally","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-83/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1dwk7:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391116","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391116","key":"PDFBOX-82","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/8","id":"8","description":"The described issue is not actually a problem - it is as designed.","name":"Not A Problem"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Wed Mar 13 17:18:53 UTC 2013","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_238935773728_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84991","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2013-03-13T17:18:53.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-82/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-08-17T06:16:00.000+0000","priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"1.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lehmi","name":"lehmi","key":"lehmi","emailAddress":"andreas at lehmi dot de","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lehmi&avatarId=19531","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lehmi&avatarId=19531","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lehmi&avatarId=19531","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lehmi&avatarId=19531"},"displayName":"Andreas Lehmk√ºhler","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2013-03-13T17:18:53.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Momentarily in a first step i have to \nindex about 80 PDF-Documents (later approximatly \n1000 documents). Ca. 60 documents (of the 80) are \nextracted by PDFBox without any problems. But for \naround 20 documents, PDFBox generates too many \nspaces, which means, that words like \"hostname\" are \nextracted to \"ho stna me\". This happens by nearly all \nwords contained in these 20 documents.\nBecause i have to extract page-information i am using \nPDFTextStripper with the methods setPageSeparator\n(..), setStartPage(..), setEndPage(..) and writeText():\n\nStringWriter s = new StringWriter();\nPDDocument pddoc = null;\ntry {\n pddoc = PDDocument.load(f);\n int pageCount = pddoc.getPageCount();\n PDFTextStripper stripper = new \nPDFTextStripper();\n stripper.setPageSeparator\n(IndexFiles.DOCUMENT_PAGE_SEPARATOR);\n stripper.setStartPage(1);\n stripper.setEndPage(pageCount);\n stripper.writeText(pddoc, s);\n} finally {\n if (pddoc != null)\n  pddoc.close();\n}\nStringBuffer contents = s.getBuffer();\n\nIn respect for my indexing-service it is impossible to \nindex these documents correctly.\n\nI have tried to BugFix PDFBox \n(PDFTextStripper.flushText()) and established, that the \nwidth returned by TextPosition.getWidth() is incorrect. \nWhen i multiply this width with TextPosition.getXScale\n(), these documents are extracted correctly. But other \nbefore correctly extracted documents loose nearly all \nspaces, which means, that a complete sentence dont \ncontain any spaces between words.\n\nI have tried: PDFBox-0.7.2-dev-20050730.jar, but the \nproblem still remains.\n\nExample Text-Output:\n\n3.5 SSL V erbindunge n\n      ‚Ä¢ JSSE (Java Sec ure So ck et E xt en sion)\n      ‚Ä¢ im po rt ja vax .n et .ss l. *\n      ‚Ä¢ W ese nt lich e ¬®And erung im Cl ient Pr ogr \namm : (F act o ry\n      P att e rn )\n      Erse tze\n      Soc ket s = new Soc ket (ho stna me, port numb er)\n      du rc h\n      SSL Soc ketF acto ry s f = (SS LSoc ketF acto ry)\nS SLS ocke tFac tory .get Def ault ();\n      SSL Soc ket s = (SSL Sock et) sf.c reat eSoc ket( \nhos tnam e, p ortn umbe r);\n      ‚Ä¢ Daf ¬®u r mus s SSL k o n fig u riert sein (si ehe \nunten).\n      V o rl ¬®aufige V.......\n\n\n[attachment on SourceForge]\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=78314&atid=552832&aid=1251041&file_id=144276\n03_2_SSL.pdf (application/pdf), 189828 bytes\nuniversity-lecture","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"204781","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"PDF-Extraction splits words by spaces","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jukkaz","name":"jukkaz","key":"jukkaz","emailAddress":"jukka at apache dot org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jukkaz&avatarId=15130","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jukkaz&avatarId=15130","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jukkaz&avatarId=15130","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jukkaz&avatarId=15130"},"displayName":"Jukka Zitting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-77/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0zfav:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391110","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391110","key":"PDFBOX-76","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/8","id":"8","description":"The described issue is not actually a problem -

Adobe \ntechnical spec 5176 CFF talks about the file format.  It is a \nbinary format that looks pretty straighforward, should be \npretty fun to write a parser for it.\n\nThis is not a high priority right now, but if someone is willing \nto write the parser I will integrate it.  If you would like to write \na parser please let me know and we can discuss, it needs to \nbe somewhat robust as the data structures it creates should \nsupport modifying data so the font can be written back to a \nstream, which will support embedding fonts back into the pdf \ndocument.\n\nIf this parser is written, I may start a separate project that just \ndeals with font files in java, PDFBox currently has parsers for \nTTF/PFB and soon CFF I see more advanced font \nrequirements in the pipeline, this type of functionality is really \noutside the scope of PDFBox but I don't believe anything else \nexists.  I am sure if I start a font library project there are other \njava libraries that could make use of it as well\n\nBen Litchfield","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"248436","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Text Extraction Unsuccessful with PDFBox","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-76/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i16wqn:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391109","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391109","key":"PDFBOX-75","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/1","id":"1","description":"A problem which impairs or prevents the functions of the product.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21133&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Bug","subtask":false,"avatarId":21133},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/5","id":"5","description":"All attempts at reproducing this issue failed, or not enough information was available to reproduce the issue.

I will create an example of adding a \nPrint only water mark and then close this issue.\n\nBen Litchfield\n\n\nFrom User:\n\nIs anything actually required to implement this.

This is because you only look\nat the page rotation rather than the transformation\nmatrix. I.e. the page may not have a rotation but the\ntext itself may be rotated (e.g. because the text\ntransformation matrix contains a rotation). \n\nYou do this just before calling showCharacter() at the\nend of the method showString(). I fixed this in my\nversion by using the following method to retrieve the\nrotation:\n\n/**\n * Returns the current absolute rotation of the text.\n * @param ctm the current transformation matrix.\n * @param textTransformationMatrix the transformation\nmatrix\n *              of the text.\n * @return the current absolute rotation of the text. The \n *              returned value is one of 0, 90, 180, 270\n */\nprotected int getTextRotation (\n Matrix ctm, Matrix textTransformationMatrix\n) {\n // compute the rotation\n Matrix m=(Matrix) textTransformationMatrix.clone();\n m.multiply(ctm);\n float a= m.getValue(0,0);\n float b= m.getValue(0,1);\n float c= m.getValue(1,0);\n float d= m.getValue(1,1);\n int rotation=0;\n if (Math.abs(a * d) > Math.abs(b * c)) {\n  rotation= (d>0) ? 0 : 180;\n } else {\n  rotation= (c<0) ? 90 : 270;\n }\n return rotation;\n}\n\nI'm using the rotation returned by this method instead\nof the pageRotation to calculate the\ntotalStringDisplacement. Also, you may want to add the\nhandling of a 180 rotation.\n\nI don't know if somehow we have to take the\npageRotation in consideration or whether this is\nalready included in the CTM.\n\ncheers\nYves","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"206062","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"TextPosition.width incorrect if text is rotated","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-66/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0zn7j:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391099","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391099","key":"PDFBOX-65","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/2","id":"2","description":"A new feature of the product, which has yet to be developed.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21141&avatarType=issuetype","name":"New Feature","subtask":false,"avatarId":21141},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/6","id":"6","description":"The problem isn't valid and it can't be fixed.","name":"Invalid"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"2005-06-24 15:07:00.0","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_293355406949_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84842","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2014-10-10T22:43:46.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-65/watchers","watchCount":0,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-06-24T15:07:00.000+0000","priority":null,"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2014-10-10T22:43:46.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

I uses this cool tool to convert \ndocuments written in many languages. I have  problems with \nsome Polish documents. The Polish special characters are not \nwell converted in some cases. I attached an example document \n(polish.pdf ? generated by the OpenOffice1.4) witch  illustrates \nthe problem. A PDFTextStriper class reads Polish characters \nbut in wrong order at the ?textList? list (see flushText() method). \nThese characters are placed at the end of each line of the text. A \nx coordinate of the corresponding TextPosition elements are \nvalid so it is possible to reorder elements on the ?textList?. I \nwrote correction of the PDFTextStripper class which solves the \nproblem. The fixed version is attached. Maybe similar \nproblems could occur for other languages or different PDF \ndocuments. \n \nA second problem I met is also related with the Polish \ncharacters. In some documents the TextPosition objects \ncorresponding to the Polish letters has width set to 0.0. The x \ncoordinates are valid in such situations so a document is \nproperly displayed but there are some errors during text \nextraction. Some extra spaces occurs within the words. I \neliminated this problem increasing the word-space factor from \n0.5f to 0.65f in the flushText method. This correction cause \nproblems for some English documents (few words may be \njoined) so I uses this correction only for documents written in  \nPolish. Is it possible to deal with this problem in more \nsophisticated way ? A code like - if (isPolish) {...} - is not so \nsmart I suppose :-). I attached an example document \n(polish2.pdf). My correction specialized for the Polish language \nis available in the attached PDFTextStriper class. \n \nThanks for help! \nJakub Strychowski \n\n[attachment on SourceForge]\nhttp://sourceforge.net/tracker/download.php?group_id=78314&atid=552832&aid=1196559&file_id=133255\nbug_polish_characters.tar.gz (application/x-tgz), 178409 bytes\nexample documents and fixed class","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"204673","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Problems with text extraction form Polish documents.","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-58/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0zemv:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391091","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391091","key":"PDFBOX-57","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/2","id":"2","description":"A new feature of the product, which has yet to be developed.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21141&avatarType=issuetype","name":"New Feature","subtask":false,"avatarId":21141},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/8","id":"8","description":"The described issue is not actually a problem - it is as designed.","name":"Not A Problem"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Fri Oct 10 22:46:16 UTC 2014","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_297812536973_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84840","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2014-10-10T22:46:16.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-57/watchers","watchCount":1,"isWatching":false},"created":"2005-05-04T01:04:00.000+0000","priority":null,"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"customfield_12312337":null,"customfield_12312338":null,"updated":"2014-10-10T22:46:16.000+0000","customfield_12312335":null,"customfield_12312336":null,"status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

The PDF contains a \ntext field that is supposed to display a bar code roated by 90 \ndegrees. The bar code will be displayed by using a special \nfont (i.e. Code-39-30). After creating the PDF with PDFBox, \nthe bar code is displayed, however not rotated. Only after \nclicking into the text field, the bar code is rotated. Similar \nbehaviour as descibed below.\nAs we plan to use this in a customer portal and the printed \ndocuments have to be scanned automatically with the rotated \nbar code, you can imagine that a bugfix for this problem is \nvery important and urgent for us.\n\nThanks in advance for your help\nDaniel\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by benlitchfield.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=601708\n\nThe problem is that PDFBox is not correctly generating the \nappearance stream for the field.  When you click in the field \nAcrobat will regenerate it, which is why it switches back and \nforth between correct and incorrect. \n\nThanks for the example docs, I will let you know when I get a \nchance to look at it.\n\nBen\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by seafoxx.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=305823\n\nI think that my problem posted 3 weeks ago is the same as\nthis bug.\n\nwhen selecting the field the style changes to \"as it should\nbe\", when leaving the style changes back to \"how it not\nshould be\". I added two example-pdf files. the first one is\nthe original (template-pdf) with some fields having the\n\"comb of x characters\" option enabled (did it with adobe,\nnot with pdfbox). the second file is the filled pdf, read it\nwith pdfbox, filled some fields with \"setText()\" and then\nsaved it back to disk.\n\nI didn't add the two files to the bug, because they are\nquite big (420k each).\n\noriginal text form my forum post:\n\nOne defines, how many letters should be placed inside the\ntext field and the letters will all have the same distance\nbetween each other. I need this option because i have\nseveral fixed-length input fields and need to place the\nletters on the correct positions. \nan examlpe of the template-pdf placed at \nhttp://kaempfe.net/pdf/pdfboxexample_before.pdf \nwhen filling the form fields with pdfbox everyting works\nfine, but the comb-option gets almost lost. the output pdf\ndoes not display the form fields correctly, the comb-option\nseems to be activated when focussing one form field and\ndeactivated on leaving that field. the fields are not\nread-only, so one can edit them in the output-pdf also. when\ndoing that, the comp-options comes back and the letters stay\nin place when leaving the form field. \nan example of the output-pdf is placed at \nhttp://kaempfe.net/pdf/pdfboxexample_after.pdf\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by seafoxx.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=305823\n\nI have the same problem when using PDField.setComb(true)

Don't worry about the blank page.\n The pdf is also beeing validated by our in-house pdf \nexpert. I've\ntryed it today.\n Sadly, it is urgent for us to deliver a correct version \nof the pdf\nto our customer, I think we will buy a version of \n PdfLib (we control\nit via a JNI Bridge)..\n Anyhow, if you find a way of implementing the \nlinearization in\nPDFBox, I will be happy to throw away PdfLib.\n I think a constructor like \norg.pdfbox.pdmodel.PDDocument(COSDocument\ndoc, boolean linearize) would be nice, and sorry  I \ndon't have time to\nhelp you in enhancing PdfBox now. (Maybe I'll write some \nexamples of basic\nusage pattern of your  library)\n\n\nSee the following for examples.\nLinearized_c_14720040602en00010001.pdf\nNot_Linearized_c_14720040602en00010001.pdf","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"289350","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Linearize command line tool","creator":null,"subtasks":[],"reporter":null,"customfield_12310291":null,"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"environment":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-19/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1dwfb:"}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"12391052","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12391052","key":"PDFBOX-18","fields":{"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/2","id":"2","description":"A new feature of the product, which has yet to be developed.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21141&avatarType=issuetype","name":"New Feature","subtask":false,"avatarId":21141},"timespent":null,"project":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/project/12310760","id":"12310760","key":"PDFBOX","name":"PDFBox","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=small&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=xsmall&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/projectavatar?size=medium&pid=12310760&avatarId=11734"},"projectCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/projectCategory/10360","id":"10360","description":"Apache PDFBox projects","name":"PDFBox"}},"fixVersions":[],"aggregatetimespent":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/resolution/2","id":"2","description":"The problem described is an issue which will never be fixed.","name":"Won't Fix"},"customfield_12312322":null,"customfield_12310220":null,"customfield_12312520":null,"customfield_12312323":null,"customfield_12312521":"Tue Jun 17 19:30:53 UTC 2014","customfield_12312320":null,"customfield_12310222":"1_*:*_1_*:*_309013673440_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12310420":"84850","customfield_12312321":null,"resolutiondate":"2014-06-17T19:30:52.000+0000","workratio":-1,"customfield_12312328":null,"customfield_12312329":null,"customfield_12312923":null,"customfield_12312326":null,"customfield_12312920":null,"customfield_12310300":null,"customfield_12312327":null,"customfield_12312921":null,"customfield_12312324":null,"customfield_12312720":null,"customfield_12312325":null,"lastViewed":null,"watches":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/PDFBOX-18/watchers","watchCount":2,"isWatching":false},"created":"2004-09-01T06:23:00.000+0000","priority":null,"labels":[],"customfield_12312333":null,"customfield_12312334":null,"customfield_12310310":"0.0","customfield_12312331":null,"customfield_12312332":null,"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12311120":null,"customfield_12312330":null,"versions":[],"customfield_12312339":null,"issuelinks":[{"id":"12389465","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLink/12389465","type":{"id":"12310000","name":"Duplicate","inward":"is duplicated by","outward":"duplicates","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/12310000"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"12474577","key":"PDFBOX-832","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12474577","fields":{"summary":"Extract text from table, or find table co-ordinates from page.

This content is surrounded by BMC/EMC\ntags which contain information to which element object the\ncontained content belongs.This is what i got from pdf reference.\n\nRegards,\nQumar.\n\n\n[comment on SourceForge]\nOriginally sent by benlitchfield.\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=601708\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-access/f1040ez_accessible.pdf\nwould be a good form to start with.\n\nIf you notice they are putting labels on the form fields.  \nthese labels contain meta data critical to building tax \nsoftware in rapid fashion.  Without this meta data, the \nname of the form field is meaningless. It would be nice to \nextract this information so I can combine it with other \ndata about the field (name, type, location, etc).  I \nalready know PDFBox can extract the other information about \nthe fields.

\nuser_id=1468838\n\nIt would be nice if pdfbox can provide the ability to\nextract information from tagged PDF.As Adobre Acrobat Reader\nprovides the tags for the pdf, pdfbox should also try to get\nthe tagged pdfs.\n\nfor example if iwe have a pdf file with a para1 under\nheader1 and para2 under header 2 and a table with rows and\ncolumns.something like \n \nHeader1 \nThis is a para 1 ,it describes about a disease.  \nHeader2 \nThis is a para2,describes remedies of disease. \nTable \nA B  \nC D \n \n \nNow the tagged pdf looks like below in adobe acrobat reader\n \n<Heading 1> \nHeader1 \n<Normal>  \nThis is a para 1 ,it describes about a disease. \n<Heading 1> \nHeader1 \n<Normal>  \nThis is a para2,describes remedies of disease. \n<Heading 1> \nTable \n<Table> \n<TBody> \n<TR> \n<TD> \n<Normal> \nA \n<TD> \n<Normal> \nB \n<TR> \n<TD> \n<Normal> \nC \n<TD> \n<Normal> \nD \n\nhow can we extract the Heading1 ,Heading 2 and tabular data\nusing pdfbox.\n\nThis is a good feature which should be added to the armory\npdfbox.\n\nPlease provide this feature.","customfield_10010":null,"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"204744","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"extract
